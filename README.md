# FML
FML specification - a general purpose modeling language for people who hate UML

##Specification
In FML there are two things: boxes and lines. Boxes may contain anything. 

There is only one relation. Either two boxes are connected by a line, or they are not.

Thus ends the specification.
##Recommended implementation
Drawn by hand, shittily and with ink. 

Landscape mode diagrams: it should be wider than it is tall
